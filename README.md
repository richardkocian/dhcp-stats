## Summary
Application that is able to sniff dhcp packets and generate network prefixes usage statistics.

## Building and running the application
To build the application open terminal in this folder and run:

    $ make
Make command will compile the program through g++ compiler, then
you can run application by running:

    $ ./dhcp-stats [-r filename] [-i interface-name] ip-prefix [ip-prefix [ ... ]]

* `-r filename`: specifies file for analyzing dhcp packets
* `-i interface-name`: specifies interface for analyzing dhcp packets
* `ip-prefix`: IPv4 prefixes from which the program will generate statics (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx)

Constraints:
There should be passed parameter -r or -i but not both together.

Example run:

    $ ./dhcp-stats -i en0 142.251.36.68/20
